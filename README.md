## Helping Hands

The challenges faced by _underprivileged groups such as electricians, plumbers, and other semi-skilled workers_ are significant and multifaceted. High unemployment rates, limited access to quality job opportunities, and inadequate educational resources perpetuate economic inequality and poverty within these communities. This is the pressing challenge that **Helping Hands** aims to address head-on.. By providing a space for employers to list jobs, and for professionals to showcase their skills, we are fostering connections that can lead to meaningful employment. Our initiative directly addresses **UN Sustainable Development *Goals 1 (No Poverty)* and *8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth)***, contributing to a more equitable and prosperous world.
